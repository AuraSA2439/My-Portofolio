### Hey there! I am Aura SA

A student at Telkom University who is into design and webnovels. Adding to that I'm quite adept at front-end with HTML/CSS as my main code language.<br>

And this is my Portofolio:

- What I'm currently working on: Common Dashboard
- What I'm currently Learning: Cloud Computing
- What I'm looking to collaborate on: Haven't thought about it
- What I'm looking for help with: None currently
- Ask me about: Anime, games, webnovels (especially chinese ones)
- How to reach me: ...
- Fun fact about me: I'm actually more leaning to design/front-end, but instead I'm trying to get my qualification on back-end XD
